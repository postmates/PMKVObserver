/// A class that manages a single KVO observation.
///
/// This class does not retain the observed object, and if the observed object deallocates,
/// this class automatically unregisters the KVO.
/// An observing object may also be provided. If it is, it is also not retained, and if the
/// observering object deallocates, this class automatically unregisters the KVO.
///
/// In Swift, the initializers and callbacks provide a strongly-typed access to the observed object.
/// In Objective-C, the initializers and callbacks use <tt>id</tt>.
///
/// This class is thread-safe and observation and deregistration may occur on any thread.
/// Deregistration may also occur within the initial callback when using
/// <tt>NSKeyValueObservingOptions.Initial</tt>. It's safe for the callback block to retain
/// the <tt>KVObserver</tt>, but because it's awkward to set that up, the callback is provided
/// with the \c KVObserver object as well. However, the callback should not retain \c object or
/// \c observer (if provided).
///
/// If the observing object does not want to unregister the KVO (until either it or the observed
/// object deallocates), it may freely discard this class instance. It only needs to hold onto
/// this class instance if it wants to unregister manually.
///
/// @note If observing a key path with multiple components, and one of those components is a
/// \c weak reference, if the referenced object deallocates without sending any KVO events for
/// the property, then this will likely result in an exception. This is due to how KVO works and
/// cannot be handled by <tt>KVObserver</tt>.
///
/// @note Any observed object must support weak references, and when using the optional observing
/// object support, it also must support weak references.
